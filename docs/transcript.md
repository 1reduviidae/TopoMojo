Let me introduce you to TopoMojo.
Topomojo is a simple cyber lab player and builder.
The name references the "magical" creation of computer network topologies.

The player interface allows one to browse existing labs, start one of them, and access the various hosts to accomplish the lab objectives.

If you want to collaborate with others, invite them to your running instance by sharing a link with them.

For content creators, people with a lab idea they'd like to share with others, the builder interface provides a simple way to do that.

Create a new lab with a name. 
Add machines by selecting from existing templates.
To put machines on the same network, give them the same network name.
If your machine needs modifications, `unlink` it from it's base template.
After modifying the machine, `save` it to persist it's new state.
While preparing your machines, you can upload files that are accessible on the machine's cd-rom drive.

Note that by default, people can have a single workspace that supports 3 machines.
If you need more resources, request them through the help desk.

When everything is ready, `publish` your lab so others can discover it!

TopoMojo is open-source, and a ready-to-go appliance is available for download.
The one external requirement is VMware esxi hypervisors.
The TopoMojo server needs to connect with esxi hypervisors or VCenter to orchestrate the virtual resources.
See the TopoMojo Administrator Guide for discussion on deployment scenarios.
